This code takes pooled read data from evolved populations of Mimulus guttatus and processes it from raw fastq files to filtered VCFs using standard bioinformatic tools including bwa, bcftools, picard tools, gatk, bedtools and VCFtools. The files are processed as a SLURM array job. R scripts used to analyze the resultant data and generate statistics and graphs are available upon request. They will be uploaded at the time the preprint is online.
